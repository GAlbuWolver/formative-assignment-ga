          <p>
            The Toronto Raptors are a Canadian professional basketball team
            based in Toronto. The Raptors compete in the National Basketball
            Association (NBA) as a member of the Atlantic Division of the
            Eastern Conference. The team plays its home games at Scotiabank
            Arena, which it shares with the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National
            Hockey League (NHL). The team was founded in 1995 as part of the
            NBA's expansion into Canada, along with the Vancouver Grizzlies.
            Since the 2001â€“02 season, the Raptors have been the only
            Canadian-based team in the league, as the Grizzlies relocated from
            Vancouver to Memphis, Tennessee.
